# 4. k8s-generate-resources
### This module is useful to generate the Kubernetes resources.

It can either be opinionated defaults or based on the configuration provided in XML config or resource fragments in src/main/jkube. Generated resources are in target/classes/META-INF/jkube/kubernetes directory.

In this module, I'm going to show you how to generate resources based on the configuration provided in XML config pom.xml file

Once you're done with your setup, please run below commands in your terminal. This will create a yaml file in a target/classes/META-INF/jkube/kubernetes directory.
```sh
cd k8s-generate-resources
mvn k8s:resource
```
As you see in yaml file, the generated yaml file based on the xml configuration and some default configuration from the plugin.

``` yaml
spec:
    template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - env:
            - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            - name: HOSTNAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
            image: acrfcngrptest.azurecr.io/hanghan93/k8s-generate-resources:latest
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            name: hanghan93-k8s-generate-resources
            securityContext:
              privileged: false
```

The above yaml snippet generated by the plugin, and it's easy to override the values from the plugin or want to do some complex thing then you can use the resource fragments.
Please check the next module to see how to customize the yaml file.
